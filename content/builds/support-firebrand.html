                    <li>Under "General Options" / "User Interface" check "Always show squad health bars" and "Always show party health bars".

                    <li>Under "Squad Options" uncheck "View as a grid". This will allow you to keep track of your allies' boons, conditions, and health, enabling better decision-making and skill management.</li>

        {{< section title="The Core of Build" >}}
            <p>The core of this build consists of {{% inlines/specialization name="Firebrand" %}} specialization which grants you access to powerful boon support, {{% inlines/trait name="Pure of Heart" %}} trait which is your primary healing source via {{% inlines/effect name="Aegis" %}}, and {{% inlines/trait name="Battle Presence" %}} which shares your {{% inlines/skill name="Virtue of Resolve" %}} passive to allies to constant healing.</p>
            <p>The {{% inlines/specialization name="Firebrand" %}} specialization brings you {{% inlines/skill name="Tome of Resolve" %}} and {{% inlines/skill name="Tome of Courage" %}}. Both of them bring new skill sets which grant you access to an extremely powerful boon support, healing, and condition cleansing as well as unique buff for your alles. It's fundamental to know when to enter and stow a tome, how to support while a tome is on cooldown.</p>
            <p>{{% inlines/trait name="Pure of Heart" %}} is your primary trait to keep your allies' health. It will heal if your {{% inlines/effect name="Aegis" %}} blocks an attack. One source of {{% inlines/effect name="Aegis" %}} comes from your {{% inlines/skill name="Mantra of Solace" %}} and sometimes your Mace. The {{% inlines/specialization name="Honor" %}} specialization also brings you {{% inlines/trait name="Selfless Daring" %}} which heals your allies when you dodge roll.</p>
            <p>{{% inlines/trait name="Battle Presence" %}} share your {{% inlines/skill name="Virtue of Resolve" %}} passive to allies which is a health regeneration. Coupled with {{% inlines/trait name="Purity of Body" %}}, your {{% inlines/skill name="Virtue of Resolve" %}} passive can also regenerate endurance. With {{% inlines/trait name="Loremaster" %}}, you retain {{% inlines/skill name="Virtue of Resolve" %}} and {{% inlines/skill name="Virtue of Courage" %}} passives even when they are on cooldown.</p>
            {{< tabs >}}
                {{< tab title="Aegis" >}}
                    <p>Your primary healing comes from {{% inlines/effect name="Aegis" %}} which is synergistic with {{% inlines/trait name="Pure of Heart" %}}.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Healing skill {{% inlines/skill name="Mantra of Solace" %}} grants {{% inlines/effect name="Aegis" %}} to allies.</li>
                        <li>Mace #3 {{% inlines/skill name="Protector's Strike" %}} blocks an attack for allies and grants them {{% inlines/effect name="Aegis" %}} .</li>
                        <li>Shield #4 {{% inlines/skill name="Shield of Absorption" %}} grants allies {{% inlines/effect name="Aegis" %}}.</li>
                        <li>{{% inlines/trait name="Resolute Subconscious" %}} is a defensive trait that you gain {{% inlines/effect name="Resolution" %}} and {{% inlines/effect name="Aegis" %}} when disabled.</li>
                        <li>Most skills in your {{% inlines/skill name="Tome of Courage" %}} grant {{% inlines/effect name="Aegis" %}} or other defensive boons to allies.</li>
                    </ul>
                {{< /tab >}}
                {{< tab title="Healing" >}}
                    <p>One of the important purposes is to maintain allies' sustainability. Your {{% inlines/skill name="Virtue of Resolve" %}} passive is shared to allies because of {{% inlines/trait name="Battle Presence" %}}.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>{{% inlines/trait name="Selfless Daring" %}} heals on dodging.</li>
                        <li>{{% inlines/trait name="Force of Will" %}} increases your vitality and improves your healing based on your vitality.</li>
                        <li>Most skills in your {{% inlines/skill name="Tome of Resolve" %}} grant {{% inlines/effect name="Regeneration" %}} and heal allies.</li>

                {{< /tab >}}
                {{< tab title="Virtues" >}}
                    <p>Virtues are fundamental to play {{% inlines/profession name="Firebrand" %}}, most of your healing, boon support, and condition cleansing are dependent on virtues.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>{{% inlines/trait name="Purity of Body" %}} improves {{% inlines/skill name="Virtue of Resolve" %}} passive with endurance regeneration.</li>
                        <li>{{% inlines/trait name="Inspired Virtue" %}} applies {{% inlines/effect name="Might" %}}, {{% inlines/effect name="Regeneration" %}}, or {{% inlines/effect name="Protection" %}} to allies when you enter a tome.</li>
                        <li>{{% inlines/trait name="Virtue of Resolution" %}} applies {{% inlines/effect name="Resolution" %}} to allies when you enter a tome.</li>
                        <li>{{% inlines/trait name="Absolute Resolve" %}} improves {{% inlines/skill name="Virtue of Resolve" %}} passive with more healing and when you enter {{% inlines/skill name="Tome of Resolve" %}}, you will remove 3 conditions from allies.</li>
                        <li>{{% inlines/trait name="Power of the Virtuous" %}} reduces recharges of tomes.</li>
                        <li>{{% inlines/trait name="Liberator's Vow" %}} grants allies {{% inlines/effect name="Quickness" %}} when you use {{% inlines/skill name="Mantra of Solace" %}}.</li>
                        <li>{{% inlines/trait name="Loremaster" %}} reduces recharge of your chapter skills and retain your {{% inlines/skill name="Virtue of Resolve" %}} and {{% inlines/skill name="Virtue of Courage" %}} passives even they are on cooldown</li>
                    </ul>

            {{< /tabs >}}
        {{< /section >}}

        {{< section title="Tomes" >}}
            <p>Your {{% inlines/skill name="Tome of Justice" %}} brings you {{% inlines/effect name="Burning" %}} pressure; however, you should notice your {{% inlines/effect name="Burning" %}} will be {{% inlines/effect name="Aegis" %}} if your opponent converts them.</p>
            <p>Your {{% inlines/skill name="Tome of Resolve" %}} brings you instant and continual healing to allies.</p>
            <p>Your {{% inlines/skill name="Tome of Courage" %}} brings you strong {{% inlines/effect name="Aegis" %}}, {{% inlines/effect name="Resolution" %}}, {{% inlines/effect name="Stability" %}} for your allies.</p>
        {{< /section >}}

        {{< section title="Skills" >}}
            {{< tabs >}}
                {{< tab title="Skills" >}}
                    <p>{{% inlines/skill name="Stand Your Ground!" %}} is immensely strong in group fight and provides 5 stacks of {{% inlines/effect name="Stability" %}} with considerable duration for your party. This is your main and most important source of group {{% inlines/effect name="Stability" %}}. Don't use {{% inlines/skill name="Stand Your Ground!" %}} as a stun-break unless it's absolutely necessary; you can use {{% inlines/skill name="Mantra of Liberation" %}} as your stun-break instead.</p>
                    <p>Besides {{% inlines/skill name="Stand Your Ground!" %}}, most of your skills are mantras, and they have reduced recharge time. Mantras from {{% inlines/profession name="Firebrand" %}} have powerful "final charge" which grant powerful effects, but you have to re-cast them after cooldown. Think twice before using the final charge.</p>
                    <p>{{% inlines/skill name="Mantra of Solace" %}} is your healing skill and grant {{% inlines/effect name="Aegis" %}} to allies. {{% inlines/skill name="Mantra of Solace" %}} only heals yourself.</p>
                    <p>{{% inlines/skill name="Mantra of Lore" %}} is your on demand AoE condition cleansing, and it also grants allies {{% inlines/effect name="Regeneration" %}}. Use {{% inlines/skill name="Mantra of Lore" %}} whenever condition cleansing is required.</p>
                    <p>{{% inlines/skill name="Mantra of Liberation" %}} is your on-demand stun-break and grants {{% inlines/effect name="Stability" %}} to allies. You can use {{% inlines/skill name="Mantra of Liberation" %}} whenever maintaining {{% inlines/effect name="Stability" %}} or stun-break is necessary. We recommend to use {{% inlines/skill name="Mantra of Liberation" %}} over {{% inlines/skill name="Stand Your Ground!" %}} when you are not sure if the enemy is going to push or just fake push; also when we are just committing a small and ranged skirmish.</p>
                    <p>{{% inlines/skill name="Signet of Mercy" %}} can be a savior if you cast it well at the right mate. Coordinated the usage with your team to save those stunned, pulled, or downed during regrouping.</p>
                {{< /tab >}}
                {{< tab title="Staff" >}}
                    <p>Your {{% inlines/skill name="Empower" %}} is a good opening skill to stack Might; {{% inlines/skill name="Line of Warding" %}} is a strong crowd control and can be used as offensive and defensive skill.</p>
                {{< /tab >}}
                {{< tab title="Mace / Shield" >}}
                    <p>The Mace / Shield can be a defensive weapon set.</p>

        {{< /section >}}

        {{< section title="Playstyles" >}}
            <p>In a party, you should provide your unique support and avoid overlapping skills with your teammates. If you are paired with {{% inlines/profession name="Scrapper" text="Support Scrapper" %}} or {{% inlines/profession name="Tempest" text="Support Tempest" %}}, all provide healing but only you provide a large amount of {{% inlines/effect name="Stability" %}}. Thus you should prioritize your {{% inlines/effect name="Stability" %}} and fill the gap of healing for your teammate.</p>
