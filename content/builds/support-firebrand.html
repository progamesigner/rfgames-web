            <p>The {{% inlines/specialization name="Firebrand" %}} specialization brings you {{% inlines/skill name="Tome of Resolve" %}} and {{% inlines/skill name="Tome of Courage" %}}. Both of them bring new skill sets which grant you access to an extremely powerful boon support, healing, and condition cleansing as well as unique buff for your alles.

        {{< /section >}}

        {{< section title="Tomes" >}}
            <p>Your {{% inlines/skill name="Tome of Justice" %}} brings you {{% inlines/effect name="Burning" %}} pressure; however, you should notice your {{% inlines/effect name="Burning" %}} will be {{% inlines/effect name="Aegis" %}} if opponent convert them.</p>
            <p>Your {{% inlines/skill name="Tome of Resolve" %}} brings you instant and continual healing to allies.</p>

        {{< /section >}}

        {{< section title="Skills" >}}
            <p>{{% inlines/skill name="Stand Your Ground!" %}} is an immensely strong in group fight and provides 5 stacks of {{% inlines/effect name="Stability" %}} with considerable duration for your party. This is your main and most important source of group {{% inlines/effect name="Stability" %}}. Don't use {{% inlines/skill name="Stand Your Ground!" %}} as a stunbreak unless it's absolutely necessary; you can use {{% inlines/skill name="Mantra of Liberation" %}} as your stunbreak instead.</p>
            <p>Besides {{% inlines/skill name="Stand Your Ground!" %}}, most your skills are mantras, and they have reduced recharge time. Mantras from {{% inlines/profession name="Firebrand" %}} have powerful "final charge" which grant powerful effects, but you have to re-cast them after cooldown. Think twice before using the final charge.</p>
            <p>{{% inlines/skill name="Mantra of Solace" %}} is your healing skill and grant {{% inlines/effect name="Aegis" %}} to allies. {{% inlines/skill name="Restoring Reprieve" %}} only heals yourself and the final charge {{% inlines/skill name="Rejuvenating Respite" %}} heals yourself more.</p>
            <p>{{% inlines/skill name="Mantra of Lore" %}} is your on demand AoE condition cleansing, and it also grants allies {{% inlines/effect name="Regeneration" %}}. Use {{% inlines/skill name="Opening Passage" %}} whenever condition cleansing is required. The final charge {{% inlines/skill name="Clarified Conclusion" %}} is only used when you have no access to other condition cleansing and being heavily condition pressured.</p>
            <p>{{% inlines/skill name="Mantra of Liberation" %}} is your on-demand stunbreak and grants {{% inlines/effect name="Stability" %}} to allies. You can use {{% inlines/skill name="Portent of Freedom" %}} whenever maintaining {{% inlines/effect name="Stability" %}} or stunbreak is necessary. We recommend to use {{% inlines/skill name="Portent of Freedom" %}} over {{% inlines/skill name="Stand Your Ground!" %}} when you are not sure if enemy is going to push or just fake push; also when we just committing a small and ranged skirmish. The final charge {{% inlines/skill name="Unhindered Delivery" %}} is similar to {{% inlines/skill name="Stand Your Ground!" %}}, but mainly used when you have no access to other {{% inlines/effect name="Stability" %}} sources or need a stunbreak instantly.</p>
            <p>{{% inlines/skill name="Signet of Mercy" %}} can be a savior if you cast it well at right mate. Coordinated the usage with your team to save whom stunned, pulled, or downed during regrouping.</p>
            {{< section title="Staff" >}}
                <p>Your {{% inlines/skill name="Empower" %}} is a good opening skill to stack Might; {{% inlines/skill name="Line of Warding" %}} is a strong crowd control and can be used as offensive and defensive skill.</p>
            {{< /section >}}
            {{< section title="Mace / Shield" >}}
                <p>The Mace / Shield can be a defensive weapon set.</p>
            {{< /section >}}
        {{< /section >}}

        {{< section title="Playstyles" >}}
            <p>In party, you should provide your unique support and avoid overlapping skills with your teammates. If you are paired with {{% inlines/profession name="Scrapper" text="Support Scrapper" %}} or {{% inlines/profession name="Tempest" text="Support Tempest" %}}, all provide healing but only you provide a large amount of {{% inlines/effect name="Stability" %}}. Thus you should prioritize your {{% inlines/effect name="Stability" %}} and fill the gap of healing for your teammate.</p>
